        Clarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the British Interplanetary Society.
        In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system,[8] an idea which won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine
        Medal[9] in 1963, and other honours.[10] Later he was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946–47
        and again in 1951–53.[11]

            The Information Age offers much to mankind, and I would like to think that we will rise to the challenges it presents. But it is vital to remember that information — in the sense of raw data — is not knowledge, that knowledge is not wisdom, and that wisdom is not foresight. But information is the first essential step to all of these.
